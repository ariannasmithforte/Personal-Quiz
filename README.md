# Personal-Quiz
Here is my personality quiz that I designed and developed utilizing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The website informs users through a personality quiz, whether or not they are a introvert or an extrovert through the way that the user like to read.

- The index.hmtl holds the quiz side of my website, which is a multiple choice quiz that has pictures.
- The script.js holds the adds some interation to the website, in the bottons for the questions, aswell as the counter for the button that iterates and adds the scores.
- The style.css hold all of the code that changes the background color, the images displayed, the font/font color, and many other designs in the website.
- Here below are the six images that I used in the website:
